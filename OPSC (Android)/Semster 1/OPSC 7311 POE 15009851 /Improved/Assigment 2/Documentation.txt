Question 1 is a login app, you can register a user then login. Once doing this you'll see a report of all the users details.

Question 2 I got this idea for my dad's shop, he does repairs and currently uses a book system. Once people come in to get repairs 
done (ie like soles, heels, zips ect) They get issued with a ticket. I've worked there a few times and sometimes people loose there tickets.
I then made sure to include lots of ways to search for their ticket number. Once somebody comes to collect their repair, the people at the shop 
stamp the ticket in the book to say its been fetched. For this i made it so it moves the repair info into a completed repairs table.
On inserting doesn't matter if cost is empty, part of the business strategy if the person doesn't know then the person who serves charges on the collection. Repairs other is an extra field can be empty it's for if they want it done by an date or another repair
